# cray935' Stellaris mods
This repository is my workspace for Stellaris mods.

After about a year of trial-and-error and reverse-engineering of the vanilla Stellaris files I learned much about Stellaris' scripting and architecture. However it was a pain and demanded much patience. Because of this I decided to share my files and to share every step of work. It may show you how I work and maybe it provides you information and inspiration for your own mods.
